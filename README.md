subtitleDownloader
==================

The Script basically downloads the subtitles for a movie file in its own folder with minimal effort. 
You must have python3.4 installed on your system to run the script though.

Just specify the location of the movie file in the script where specified and run it.

And voila!

It can also be used to loop through multiple files in a folder and download corresponding subtitles for each.

Cheers!
